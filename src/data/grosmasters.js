    information: `Garry Kasparov started ruling the chess world from the age of 22 as the youngest ever undisputed World Chess 
            Champion in 1985. He remained #1 until his retirement in 2005. But as they say, 
            “every Chess master was once a beginner,” and the saying holds for the champion too. 
            Garry started his training at the age of 10 at Mikhail Botvinnik’s chess school. 
            In 1978, he was accidentally entered into a professional tournament, which he won. 
            By 1983, he was ranked 2nd in the world. In 1984, he challenged for the World Title but 
            lost to Karpov in a 48-game match. The following year, however, he won the title and then 
            successfully defended it 3 times.`

    information: `Karpov was the youngest-ever Soviet National Master (age 15), 
        World junior chess champion in 1969, defeated Korchnoi and Spassky in 1974
        and challenged Bobby Fischer for the World Title. Fischer withdrew from 
        the championship match and Karpov became the Champion by default. 
        Reigning from 1975-1985 and 1993-1999 but disputed, with 160 first-place 
        tournaments, he lost his title to Garry Kasparov in 1985 after defending it 
        successfully against Kasparov just the year before.       
        He won the 1995 Linares tournament, considered to be the strongest 
        tournament in history. After defending his title to Gata Kamsky in 1996, 
        he conceded his title in 1999 in protest over FIDE rule changes to the way 
        the title was decided. This impressive record certainly qualifies him as one 
        of the greatest chess players in history.`
